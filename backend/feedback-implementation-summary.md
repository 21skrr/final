## ✅ IMPLEMENTED CHANGES

### 1. Role-Based Access Control Updates

#### Employee Endpoints
- ✅ `POST /api/feedback` - Already existed, added comment for clarity
- ✅ `GET /api/feedback/history` - Already existed, added comment for clarity

#### Supervisor Endpoints  
- ✅ `GET /api/team/feedback` - Updated to restrict access to supervisors only
- ✅ `POST /api/feedback/:feedbackId/response` - Updated to restrict access to supervisors only and updated status values

#### Manager Endpoints
- ✅ `GET /api/feedback/department` - Updated to restrict access to managers only
- ✅ `GET /api/feedback/analytics` - Updated to restrict access to managers only

#### HR Endpoints
- ✅ `GET /api/feedback/all` - Already correctly restricted to HR
- ✅ `PUT /api/feedback/:feedbackId/categorize` - Updated to restrict access to HR only and updated status values

## 🔧 SPECIFIC CHANGES MADE

### 1. Route Updates (`backend/routes/feedbackRoutes.js`)

#### Updated Role Restrictions:
- `POST /api/feedback/:feedbackId/response` - Now supervisor-only
- `GET /api/feedback/department` - Now manager-only  
- `GET /api/feedback/analytics` - Now manager-only
- `PUT /api/feedback/:feedbackId/categorize` - Now HR-only
- `POST /api/feedback/:feedbackId/escalate` - Now HR-only

#### Updated Status Values:
- Changed status validation from `["pending", "in-progress", "completed"]` to `["addressed", "pending", "in-progress"]` for response endpoint
- Changed status validation from `["pending", "in-progress", "completed"]` to `["pending", "in-progress", "addressed"]` for categorize endpoint

### 2. Team Routes Updates (`backend/routes/teamRoutes.js`)

#### Added Role Restriction:
- `GET /api/team/feedback` - Now restricted to supervisors only
- Added `checkRole` import to middleware

### 3. Team Controller Updates (`backend/controllers/teamController.js`)

#### Updated Feedback Filtering:
- Modified `getTeamFeedback` to only show feedback sent to the supervisor (where `toUserId` matches supervisor's ID)
- This ensures supervisors only see feedback that was explicitly shared with them

### 4. Feedback Controller Updates (`backend/controllers/feedbackController.js`)

#### Fixed Status Consistency:
- Updated `escalateFeedback` method to use `"in-progress"` instead of `"in_progress"`

## 🔐 AUTHENTICATION & AUTHORIZATION

All endpoints now properly enforce role-based access control:

- **Employee**: Can submit feedback, view history, edit/delete own feedback
- **Supervisor**: Can view team feedback shared with them, respond to feedback  
- **Manager**: Can view department feedback and analytics
- **HR**: Can view all feedback, categorize, escalate, and export

---

## 📊 STATUS FLOW

The feedback status flow has been standardized:

1. **Pending** - Initial state when feedback is submitted
2. **In-Progress** - Being worked on by supervisor/HR  
3. **Addressed** - Feedback has been responded to and resolved

## 🏷️ CATEGORIES & PRIORITIES

### Categories:

- **Supervisor** - Related to management and leadership  
- **Process** - Related to workflows and procedures

### Priorities:
- **Low** - Minor issues or suggestions
- **Medium** - Important but not urgent
